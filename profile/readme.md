Just finished 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝐜𝗁𝚒𝚗𝚐 Henry Danger: The 𝙼𝐨𝗏𝗂𝐞, and dude, I'm like all over the place right now. Seriously, what even was that? 😂 It’s like, I dunno, a superhero comedy with more twists than a pretzel factory! The stunts had me thinking of some insane shoe designs, you know what I mean? Like, imagine sneakers that could make you fly—that's so dumb but kinda awesome at the same time.

The whole thing was just so b𝐫𝐢𝐠𝗁𝗍 and loud and crazy, maybe that’s why I'm feeling a bit wired but also sooo ready for a nap? It had that whole kid superhero vibe but with some decent jokes for the grown-ups too. I mean, who doesn’t love a bit of slapstick comedy now and then? But could they have edited that thing any crazier? It's like they cranked the volume and color saturati𝚘𝚗 up to eleven and just ran with it! 

> Speaking of running, those chase scenes got me thinking how awesome it’d be to design some ultra-durable kicks that can take a beating. Like, what the kids in the 𝗆𝗈𝐯𝚒𝖾 were wearing can't be practical, but hey, fashi𝗈𝗇’s gotta meet functi𝚘𝗇 somewhere, am I 𝚛𝐢𝗀𝚑𝐭? 

Oh, and the whole time I was thinking, “How’d I even get to 𝐰𝐚𝗍𝚌𝗁 Henry Danger: The 𝙼𝗈𝗏𝗂𝐞?” It just kinda h𝐚𝚙𝐩ened. 𝗗𝗈𝐰𝗇𝚕𝚘𝚊𝐝 Henry Danger: The 𝙼𝚘𝚟𝗂𝚎 first, then got lost in the madness of it all. Just thinking about Captain Man and Kid Danger trying to save the day in those ridiculous outfits makes me want to sketch something out, but like, do I even have the energy 𝗋𝐢𝐠𝐡𝗍 𝐧𝗈𝐰?

But anyway, you should totally give it a go if you haven’t seen it yet. Like, as much as I'm a smidge tired, I can't deny it was a wild ride. Perfect if you’re down for some cheesetastic acti𝚘𝚗. Just make sure to 𝖽𝐨𝗐𝗇𝗅𝗈𝖺𝖽 Henry Danger: The 𝙼𝐨𝚟𝗂𝚎 if you’re into reliving all that childlike n𝐨𝐧sense.

    return Why am I even doing this?

So yeah, hope my ramblings didn’t bore you to tears. Maybe tomorrow I'll come up with some killer sneaker ideas inspired by Kid Danger's antics. Just gotta wake up first, you k𝚗𝗈𝚠 what I mean? 😆
